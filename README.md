A stupid script for using CTRL+ALT+1/2/3/4 to switch between virtual desktops for Windows 10.

It only moves between desktops; it won't create the them for you, so you need to have those virtual desktops open for it to work.

If you don't want to install autohotkey just put the .exe in Window's startup folder.
